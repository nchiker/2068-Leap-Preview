# 2068-Leap — Release 1 Beta

2068-Leap Release 1 Beta is the first public beta of the redesigned Timex Sinclair 2068
ROM. It concentrates on a practical full-screen BASIC environment, ROM
headroom, subsystem correctness, and regression coverage rather than cartridge
support.

## Release 1 Beta highlights

- Recovered ROM space with symbol-derived BASIC audits and table-driven BASIC
  execution, numeric-function, and EXROM checker dispatch.
- Established one canonical production editor implementation and documented
  the boundary between generic editing and BASIC-specific integration.
- Hardened the EXROM calculator against invalid literals, stack underflow and
  overflow, division by zero, numeric overflow, and conversion boundaries.
- Restored six standalone calculator smoke ROMs and made calculator and sprite
  simulator checks part of the normal validation gate.
- Hardened sprite parsing and state transitions: complete 16-bit range checks,
  transactional `MOVE`, safe re-`GRAB`, initialized state, and overflow-safe
  kernel bounds checks.
- Added an eight-slot display stack. Overlapping save-under sprites must be
  moved or hidden in reverse `SHOW` order; invalid operations fail before the
  screen changes.
- Global screen transformations (`CLS`, `MODE`, scrolling, editor entry, and
  paths using `CLS` such as RUN/NEW/LOAD/help) invalidate displayed sprite
  state while preserving captured images for reuse.
- Cold start now clears the complete ROM-owned `$8000-$BFFF` RAM region before
  any sysvar, bank-depth counter, hook, or port shadow is read. Startup no
  longer depends on an emulator providing zero-filled RAM.
- Replaced resident `CPLOT` with the 132-byte reference RAM BASIC extension.
  Its single-slot gateway validates the existing two-expression grammar in ROM,
  invalidates cached editor errors on registration, and unregisters on `NEW`.
- Added `SAVE "name" LINE n`; the stock autostart header field records a
  one-based statement index and a successful LOAD begins there. Invalid saved
  indices leave the program loaded without running it.
- Added literal prompted input: `INPUT "Age: ";A` and
  `INPUT "Name: ";A$`, retaining the existing numeric and string bounds.
- Retired the resident HELP screen to fund the higher-priority storage and
  input work. The editor navigation reference remains in the user manual.

## Validation baseline

- All 92 integrated BASIC fixtures pass. `BLOCK` is restored as a 168-byte loadable
  module, including reversed-corner, unloaded, and `NEW` lifecycle coverage.
  The formerly failing `gfx5` fixture exposed a harness-only initialization
  gap: the injected runner skipped production cold boot's PAPER=7 setup.
  Full-engine `MEM_INIT` now owns that shared reset, fixing the harness while
  consolidating two production calls into one.
- Added the 212-byte loadable `FRAME x0,y0 TO x1,y1` module without consuming
  Home ROM or EXROM. Its tests cover all four edges, reversed corners,
  OVER-twice restoration, unloaded rejection, and `NEW` clearing.
- Added loadable `INVERT x0,y0 TO x1,y1` without consuming Home ROM or EXROM.
  Its fixtures cover inclusive and reversed rectangles, applying twice to
  restore the bitmap, unloaded rejection, and `NEW` clearing.
- Added the 53-byte loadable `AYREG register,value` module. It uses the
  existing two-expression grammar and performs native AY port I/O locally,
  consuming no Home ROM, EXROM, or new ABI service bytes.
- Added the 39-byte loadable `OUT port,value` module. It accepts the complete
  16-bit Z80 port address, validates byte-sized data before touching hardware,
  and likewise consumes no Home ROM, EXROM, or ABI service bytes.
- Fixed successful program LOAD leaving the editor's append sentinel with a
  hardcoded statement index of zero. Loaded programs now publish their real
  statement count. A second post-load defect in the word-wrap row cache is
  also fixed: after auto-scroll changes the viewport, the cache is rebuilt for
  that settled viewport before rendering. Long mixed-width programs now open
  at the bottom with one cursor on the blank append line, rather than retaining
  a flashing phantom cursor on the first visible statement.
- Expanded the interactive showcase to use the 15,322-byte BASIC pool without
  requiring an external keyword. It now demonstrates `DEF FN`, `FREE()`,
  ULAplus graphics, sprites, and continuous two-channel AY melody/accompaniment.
- Fixed control-stack state leaking between executions: `RUN` now clears FOR
  and GOSUB depths, including frames abandoned by a runtime `GOTO`. A dedicated
  two-RUN regression harness reproduces the former failure.
- Nine standalone runtime smoke ROMs pass in Fuse.
- Fifteen standalone smoke ROM targets assemble successfully.
- Automated production-editor regression passes.
- Fixed CAPS SHIFT+ENTER's first-redraw omission: the statement shifted below
  a newly inserted blank line now remains visible immediately, before the user
  types into that blank line. The automated editor harness covers the exact
  two-statement insertion sequence and inspects physical display RAM.
- Calculator dispatcher, sprite graphics, sprite state, display-order, and
  invalidation simulator checks pass through `make check`.
- Home ROM: 1 byte free; EXROM: 2 bytes free; dynamic RAM pool: 15,322
  bytes. Transient `FILL` scratch and persistent sprite, label, UDG, editor,
  and detokenizer storage now use safe upper HOME RAM. The command-phase token,
  status, EDIT-copy, and multi-statement buffers share
  one 130-byte reservation; the follow-up audit also removed 45 bytes of dead
  state. Independent review caught two unsafe lifetime assumptions before
  commit: named LOAD now retains its filename in the edit buffer, clear of its
  status callback, and static-checker string functions again have a dedicated
  128-byte pool so they cannot overwrite an uncommitted edit line.
- The dedicated string-function pool now lives at `$F328-$F3A7` in
  always-visible chunk 7, increasing dynamic BASIC RAM by another 128 bytes
  while leaving 2,304 bytes of genuine stack headroom above the fixed extension
  state and module window. A canary-based valid
  nested-expression run observed a 126-byte peak; this is a measurement, not a
  claimed global maximum.
- Added minimal classic numeric `DEF FN`: one single-letter function, one
  numeric parameter, and an expression result (`DEF FN S(X)=X*X`, called as
  `FN S(value)`). Definitions take effect when execution reaches them;
  recursion is deliberately rejected. The measured cost is 238 Home bytes and
  102 EXROM bytes.
- Added a deterministic named-LOAD regression which stubs only the pulse
  receiver while exercising the real command parser, progress redraws,
  filename comparison, `3 -> 7 -> 4` state sequence, and installed bytes.
- A byte-exact branch audit replaced 70 eligible absolute jumps with relative
  jumps and inverted five two-branch tails. Unsupported Z80 conditions,
  historically tight branches, low-margin targets, and editor code were left
  unchanged. This recovered 11 Home-ROM and 71 EXROM bytes without changing
  RAM, fixed entry addresses, or the KTAB ABI.

## Beta boundaries

- Release 1 Beta is not cartridge-focused; cartridge support and a public cartridge ABI
  remain deferred.
- Eight fixed sprite slots reserve 2,352 bytes including metadata and display
  ordering. Reducing or dynamically allocating them remains a future option.
- Sprite restoration uses a display stack rather than a compositor, so
  `HIDE` and `MOVE` must follow reverse display order.
- The calculator is a focused internal arithmetic service, not a complete
  implementation of the original Sinclair calculator literal set.
- Programs use 2068-Leap's structured, line-number-free representation and
  are not byte-compatible with stock tokenized Sinclair BASIC programs.

The GitHub beta tag should be created only after a clean build, the complete
emulator validation gate, final Word-manual generation, and packaging of the
documented ROM and extension artifacts.
