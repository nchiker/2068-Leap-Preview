# EightyOne Setup

These instructions were confirmed by an EightyOne user with the released
Windows version 1.41.

## Preview files

The `roms/` directory contains the two files needed by EightyOne:

- `roms/test_basic.bin` — the 16K Home ROM image.
- `roms/exrom.dck` — the 8K EXROM packaged as an EightyOne Timex cartridge.

EightyOne v1.41 does not load the raw `roms/exrom.bin` as a cartridge. Its
`.dck` file is the raw EXROM preceded by these nine bytes:

```text
FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00
```

The distributed `exrom.dck` is 8201 bytes: that header followed by the exact
8192-byte contents of `exrom.bin`.

## Configure EightyOne 1.41

Open the hardware configuration and make these selections:

1. Select the **Timex** tab and the **TS2068** machine.
2. Under **Advanced Settings**, set **ROM File** to
   `roms/test_basic.bin`.
3. Leave **Protect ROM from Writes** enabled.
4. Under **Interfaces**, set **ROM Cartridge** to **Timex** and select
   `roms/exrom.dck` as the cartridge file.
5. Apply the settings and perform a hard reset.

Do not select `exrom.bin` in the ROM Cartridge field; use `exrom.dck`.

## Power-on RAM setting

This corrected preview initializes the complete ROM-owned `$8000-$BFFF` RAM
region at cold start. It should therefore boot consistently whether
EightyOne initializes RAM to zero or randomizes it. Randomized RAM is the
more useful compatibility test because it exposes accidental reads of
uninitialized state.
