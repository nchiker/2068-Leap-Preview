# 2068 Leap — User's Manual

2068 Leap is a redesigned Timex Sinclair 2068 ROM: a structured BASIC
(no line numbers — labels and `GOTO` instead),
a full-screen editor, AY-3-8912 sound, and TS2068-specific graphics, built
from scratch as documented Z80 modules rather than a copy of the original
ROM.

This manual covers what actually works today, verified against the real
source (`basic/basic.asm`, `kernel/`, `rom/exrom_*.asm`) — not the design
notes in `docs/basic_language_reference.md`, which also describes several
planned features (`REPeat`, `SELect ON`, `DEFine PROCedure`/`FuNction`,
`DATA`/`RESTORE`/`READ`, `WHEN ERRor`) that aren't built
yet. Anything described here as working has been checked against the code
that implements it. See "Known limitations" at the end for what's
deliberately left out.

### What this ROM improves

This is not simply the stock TS2068 BASIC with a few extra commands. Its
programming model has been redesigned around the machine's unique hardware:

- A persistent full-screen, word-wrapping editor replaces line-number entry.
- Labels, block `IF`, `FOR`/`NEXT`, `GOSUB`/`RETURN`, and colon-separated
  statements provide structured control flow.
- Errors are checked after each committed edit and again before `RUN`; bad
  lines are highlighted in place and have next/previous-error navigation.
- Numeric and string arrays, scalar strings, string functions, pixel graphics, sprites,
  collision detection, AY sound, High Resolution Graphics colour, and
  ULAplus palettes are accessible directly from BASIC.
- `SAVE` and `LOAD` retain standard TS2068 two-block tape framing while
  carrying this ROM's native program, with progress shown in the status bar.

ULAplus is program-scoped: every exit path restores the normal palette before
the editor reappears.

## 1. Getting started

Boot the ROM (Home ROM + EXROM) in an emulator or on real hardware and
you're dropped straight into the full-screen editor with an empty
program — there's no separate "BASIC prompt" to get to first. Whatever
you type becomes the next line of your program the moment you press
ENTER.

Type a line and press ENTER:

```
PRINT "HELLO"
```

Then type `RUN` alone on its own line and press ENTER to execute the
whole stored program. `RUN` is not a program statement — like `NEW`,
`LIST`, `EDIT`, `SAVE`, `LOAD`, and `HELP`, it's an **immediate command**:
typed alone and committed, it executes right away instead of being added
to the program (see [Immediate commands](#14-immediate-commands)).

A blank ENTER (nothing typed) does nothing — it's not an error, it's a
no-op.

Here is a small first program using several improvements together:

```basic
INK 6
DIM S(5)
FOR I = 0 TO DIMN(S)-1
S(I) = I*I
NEXT I
PRINT "LAST SQUARE=" + STR$(S(4))
IF S(4) = 16 THEN BORDER 4
```

Type `RUN` on the next blank editor line. It prints `LAST SQUARE=16` and
turns the border green.

## 2. The editor

There's one full-screen editor, always — no separate "listing" view or
"direct mode" prompt. The screen shows up to 23 rows of your program at
once (row 23 at the bottom is reserved for a status line), with the line
you're currently editing shown in plain text and every other, already
committed line shown with recognized keywords in **bold**.

### Typing

- Letters type as **lowercase by default**. Hold **CAPS SHIFT** for
  uppercase — this is a deliberate design choice for this ROM, not a
  fact about the hardware.
- Recognized keywords (`PRINT`, `INPUT`, `RUN`, `END`, `STOP`, `GOTO`,
  and every other statement/command keyword) auto-uppercase and render
  bold once a line is **committed** (ENTER), not while you're still
  typing it — a line still being typed always shows plain. A word that
  merely starts with a keyword but isn't one — `PRINTER` — is not
  mistaken for `PRINT`; a real word boundary (space, `=`, or end of
  line) is required after the match.
- ENTER commits the current line: if you're on the blank line at the
  end, it's appended as a new statement and a fresh blank line opens
  below it; if you've navigated up into an **existing** line, ENTER
  replaces that statement in place and moves down to the next line —
  exactly like a normal text editor.
- A blank ENTER (nothing typed on the line) is a no-op, whether you're
  on the new line or an existing one — it doesn't append an empty
  statement, and it doesn't replace an existing line with nothing.

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| CAPS SHIFT + 7 | Move up a line |
| CAPS SHIFT + 6 | Move down a line |
| CAPS SHIFT + 5 | Move cursor left |
| CAPS SHIFT + 8 | Move cursor right |
| CAPS SHIFT + 0 | Delete character (forward delete) |

Fuse conveniently maps your PC's actual arrow keys and Backspace key
directly to these combos, so in practice you don't need to hold Shift
and press a number — the arrow keys and Backspace just work.

Moving to an existing line loads its committed text back into the edit
buffer so you can change it. **Any uncommitted change is discarded if
you navigate away without pressing ENTER first** — there's no undo, so
type carefully; this is deliberate, not a bug.

The view scrolls automatically once your program exceeds the 23 visible
rows, keeping wherever you're editing on screen. A line long enough to
need more than one screen row word-wraps rather than running off the
edge.

### Deleting lines

- **DELETE on an already-empty existing line** removes that line outright
  and shifts everything after it up to fill the gap. (On a line that
  still has text, CAPS SHIFT+0 just deletes forward character by
  character, same as any text editor — DELETE only removes the whole
  *line* once it's already empty.)
- **CAPS SHIFT + 1** deletes the current line outright in one keystroke,
  no need to empty it first — same underlying "delete and shift up"
  behavior, just reachable directly regardless of what's currently in
  the line.
- **CAPS SHIFT + ENTER** inserts a blank line *before* the one currently
  being edited, then moves you onto that new blank line to start typing.
  No effect on the not-yet-committed new line at the end of the program
  — there's nothing meaningful to insert before there.
- **`DELETE <start>,<end>`**, typed and committed like `RUN`, removes a
  whole range of lines by their position in the current listing (1-based
  — the first line shown is line 1, matching how you'd read a listing
  top to bottom; there are still no line numbers stored anywhere, this
  is purely how you type the range). Any problem — malformed numbers, a
  missing comma, a typed `0`, `start` greater than `end`, either number
  out of range — leaves the program unchanged; a bad `DELETE` shows
  `INVALID RANGE` in the status bar for one redraw, then the offending
  text auto-removes itself the next time you navigate away.

### Errors while typing and running

Before `RUN` actually executes anything, a whole-program check pass looks
at every statement. If it finds problems, execution never starts — you're
dropped back into the editor with the status bar reading `N ERRORS FOUND`
(or `1 ERROR FOUND`) instead of the usual `LINE n/m`, and every flagged
line renders in **red** ink (keywords inside them stay bold, just
bold-red instead of bold-black). This message is deliberately not a
full-screen takeover — the whole program stays visible while you fix it.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| SYMBOL SHIFT + A | Jump to the next flagged (error) line |
| SYMBOL SHIFT + S | Jump to the previous flagged line |

Both wrap around at either end, and work from anywhere in the program.
While your cursor is on a specific flagged line, the status bar shows
*that* line's own error message instead of the overall count; moving to
an unflagged line reverts to the general count.

A **runtime** error (one the static check pass can't catch — e.g.
`DIVISION BY ZERO`, which depends on a variable's actual value) stops the
program the moment it happens and shows the error message plus the
failing statement's own text, rather than silently doing nothing.

### HELP

`HELP`, typed alone like `RUN`, lists available topics full-screen —
press any key to return to the editor exactly where you left off (mid-
edit line, error highlighting, and scroll position are all preserved).

`HELP EDITOR` shows the navigation-key summary above, directly from the
ROM:

```
EDITOR HELP

LEFT       CAPS SHIFT+5
RIGHT      CAPS SHIFT+8
UP         CAPS SHIFT+7
DOWN       CAPS SHIFT+6
DELETE CHR CAPS SHIFT+0
INSERT LN  CAPS SHIFT+ENTER
DELETE LN  CAPS SHIFT+1

NEXT ERROR SYM SHIFT+A
PREV ERROR SYM SHIFT+S

PRESS ANY KEY TO RETURN
```

`HELP <anything else>` falls back to the same topic list as bare `HELP`
— an unrecognized topic name isn't treated as an error.

## 3. Loading and saving with Fuse

`SAVE "<name>"` and `LOAD "<name>"` transfer the current program to and
from tape, using the same EAR/MIC cassette ports every Spectrum-family
machine uses for tape I/O — so in Fuse, this means the same **tape
deck** you'd use for any Spectrum program (Fuse's own Media/Tape menu:
open or record a tape file, then `SAVE`/`LOAD` from BASIC drives it, the
same relationship as a real cassette recorder).

The tape uses the stock TS2068/Sinclair 17-byte program header and
two-block transport framing. The saved program data is still this ROM's
own plain-text representation, not stock tokenized Sinclair BASIC. Stock
tools can recognize the container and header, but a stock ROM cannot run
the payload. See `docs/tape_compatibility.md` for the exact contract.

- **`SAVE "name"`** — saves the whole current program under that name
  (up to 10 characters).
- **`LOAD "name"`** — loads a program by name; the name on tape must
  match exactly, or `LOAD` fails.
- **`LOAD ""`** (empty name) — a wildcard: loads whatever program is
  found next on the tape, regardless of its name. Useful when you know
  there's only one program on the tape and don't want to retype its
  exact name.

While a `SAVE`/`LOAD` is in progress, the status line reports timing-safe
milestones: 0%, 10% after the header, and 100% after the program block.
On success it shows `SAVED 100%` or `LOADED 100%`. An unreadable or empty
tape reports `LOAD FAILED`.

Both named `LOAD "name"` and wildcard `LOAD ""` have been confirmed in
real Fuse round-trips.
Fuse does not automatically start this custom ROM's loader, so open the
tape and press Play manually after entering `LOAD`.

There's no `MERGE` — `LOAD` always replaces the current program outright,
it never combines with what's already there. Save first if you want to
keep the current program before loading another.

## 4. Program structure — labels instead of line numbers

There are **no line numbers** in this BASIC. What classic line-numbered
BASIC did with `GOTO 100` this dialect does with named **labels**:

```
main_loop:
    PRINT "hello"
    x = x + 1
    IF x < 5 THEN GOTO main_loop
PRINT "done"
```

A label is an identifier alone on its own line, ending with a colon. It
can't share a line with anything else — `loop: PRINT 1` is a syntax
error, not a label followed by a statement.

**Label names: letters only** — no digits, no underscores. `sub1:` and
`main_loop:` both fail (the parser stops at the first non-letter, and
what's left over doesn't make sense as either a label or a `GOTO`
target). Stick to plain letter sequences (`mainloop:`, `done:`,
`checkscore:`) until this is loosened.

`GOTO <label>` jumps to that label. `GOSUB <label>` / bare `RETurn` push
a return address and come back; `CALL <label>` is a second spelling of
`GOSUB` — identical behavior, just a name some people find more natural
for a "stored procedure" you're not planning to jump back *past*. Either
way, `RETurn` (with no value — this dialect has no user-defined
functions to return a value *from*) comes back to whichever one called
it.

`LIST` jumps the editor view to the top of the program. `EDIT <label>`
jumps straight to that label's own line — handy for navigating a long
program without scrolling by hand.

## 5. Control flow

### IF

Block form:

```
IF x > 10 THEN
    PRINT "big"
ELSEIF x > 0 THEN
    PRINT "small"
ELSE
    PRINT "not positive"
END IF
```

(`ENDIF`, one word, also works — not a second spelling worth relying on
deliberately, just not rejected either.)

Single-line short form, no `END IF` needed:

```
IF x = 0 THEN PRINT "zero"
```

Multiple statements after `THEN`, colon-separated, all run:

```
IF x = 0 THEN PRINT "zero": y = 1
```

There's no `ELSE` in the single-line form — use the block form if you
need one.

Conditions: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, plus `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`
(`NOT` binds tightest, then `AND`, then `OR`). A bare expression with no
relational operator is truthy/falsy the classic-BASIC way (nonzero is
true). **`AND`/`OR` do not short-circuit** — both sides always evaluate,
so `IF y <> 0 AND x/y > 1 THEN ...` still raises `DIVISION BY ZERO` when
`y` is 0, even though the guard looks like it should prevent that. This
is a known, permanent limitation, not a bug to report.

A genuinely mismatched `IF`/`END IF` (missing one or the other) isn't
caught until `RUN` — reported as `IF WITHOUT END IF`.

### FOR / NEXT

```
FOR i = 1 TO 10
    PRINT i
NEXT i
```

`STEP` defaults to 1:

```
FOR i = 10 TO 1 STEP -1
    PRINT i
NEXT
```

`NEXT`'s variable name is optional — bare `NEXT` acts on the innermost
open loop. If you do name it, it must match that loop's own variable, or
you get `NEXT VARIABLE MISMATCH`.

Classic entry semantics: if the very first check already fails (`FOR i =
5 TO 1` with the default `STEP 1`), the body never runs at all, not even
once. `STEP 0` is accepted and just never advances — an intentional
infinite loop if nothing else breaks out of it.

Loops nest up to 8 deep; a 9th concurrently open `FOR` reports `FOR
NESTED TOO DEEPLY`. `NEXT` with no open loop at all reports `NEXT
WITHOUT FOR`.

**`EXIT FOR`** breaks out of the innermost open loop early:

```
FOR i = 1 TO 100
    IF i > 5 THEN EXIT FOR
    PRINT i
NEXT i
```

Using it with no `FOR` loop open reports `EXIT WITHOUT FOR`. A genuinely
mismatched `FOR`/`NEXT` is only caught at `RUN` time, as `FOR WITHOUT
NEXT`.

### GOSUB / RETurn / CALL

```
GOSUB greet
GOTO after
greet:
    PRINT "hi"
    RETurn
after:
    PRINT "done"
```

Every `GOSUB` (or `CALL`) needs a matching `RETurn` to come back to.
Too many nested, un-returned `GOSUB`s reports `GOSUB TOO DEEP`; a stray
`RETurn` with nothing to return to reports `RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB`.

### STOP, END, PAUSE

- **`STOP`** halts the program and drops back to the editor, but
  *keeps* variable values and where you stopped, for inspection — a
  breakpoint, not a normal exit.
- **`END`** is the deliberate final stop — terminates the program
  cleanly.
- **`PAUSE <n>`** waits `n` display frames (roughly `n/50` seconds), or
  waits indefinitely for a keypress if `n` is `0`.

## 6. Variables and data

### Numeric variables

26 single-letter variables, `A` through `Z`, always available — no
declaration needed. Every number in this BASIC is a 16-bit signed
integer (-32768 to 32767); there's no float variable type (a small
number of *functions* — see [SQR/SIN/PI/RAD/DEG](#15-function-reference)
— can *display* a genuine fractional result when printed directly, but
that's a display feature of those specific functions, not a numeric
type change).

```
x = 5
y = x * 2 + 1
```

### String variables

26 more, `A$` through `Z$` — a completely separate set of storage slots
from the numeric `A`-`Z`, sharing only the letter. Each holds up to
**31 characters**; anything longer is silently truncated, not rejected.

```
A$ = "hello"
B$ = A$ + " world"
PRINT B$
```

Assignment, `PRINT`, and `=`/`<>` comparison (`IF A$ = "Q" THEN ...`) are
supported. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` are **not** supported for strings.

### Arrays

```
DIM scores(10)
scores(0) = 100
PRINT scores(0) + 1
```

`DIM name(n)` declares a **numeric** array of `n` zero-initialized
elements. `DIM name$(n)` declares up to 31 string elements, each able
to hold 31 characters. Both are indexed **0 to n-1** (0-based, not
classic BASIC's 1-based). `name(i)` or `name$(i)` reads or writes one
element, and numeric references can nest (`A(B(0)) = 99`).

```basic
DIM colour$(3)
colour$(0) = "RED"
colour$(1) = UPPER$("blue")
PRINT colour$(1)
```

A name can only be `DIM`'d once per `RUN` — re-`DIM`ing it without a
fresh `RUN` raises `ARRAY ALREADY DIMENSIONED`. Using an array before
`DIM`ing it raises `ARRAY NOT DIMENSIONED`; an out-of-range index raises
`SUBSCRIPT OUT OF RANGE`. A bad `DIM` size raises `INVALID ARRAY SIZE`,
and running out of room while allocating it raises `OUT OF MEMORY`.

`DIMN(name)` returns a numeric array's declared size; use `DIMN(name$)`
for a string array.

Arrays live in a genuinely dynamic memory region (not a fixed slot
table like the scalars above), so their capacity is limited only by
free RAM, reflected in `FREE()`.

There is no multi-dimensional (`DIM name(rows,cols)`) support.

## 7. Expressions and operators

Standard arithmetic — `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, unary minus, parentheses, with
normal precedence (`*`/`/` bind tighter than `+`/`-`):

```
x = 3 + 4 * 2        ' 11
y = (x + 1) * 2       ' 24
```

`x = x + 1` reads the *old* `x` before storing the new one, as expected.

String concatenation uses the same `+`: `"a" + "b"`, and longer chains
(`A$ + " " + B$ + "!"`) — each string term is still parsed even once the
31-character result cap is reached, but stops contributing bytes past
that point (a too-long expression is still valid, just truncated, same
as a literal).

Relational operators (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) and `AND`/`OR`/
`NOT` are covered under [IF](#5-control-flow) above — they work the same
way in any expression, not just inside `IF`.

## 8. Screen output

Text wraps automatically at column 31. When output passes the bottom of the
24-row screen, the display scrolls upward by one text row and printing
continues on the cleared bottom row. This applies to strings that cross the
right edge as well as to successive `PRINT` statements.

| Statement | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PRINT <expr>` | Print one string or numeric expression at the current row/column, then advance to the next row |
| `CLS` | Clear the screen using the *current* `PAPER` colour, and reset print position back to row 0, column 0 |
| `AT <row>,<col>` | Position the *next* `PRINT` only — row 0-23, column 0-31 (out-of-range values clamp rather than error). Wears off after that one `PRINT`; the line after resets to column 0 |
| `TAB <col>` | Same one-`PRINT`-only lifetime as `AT`, but sets column only, leaves row untouched |
| `INK <n>` | Foreground (text) colour, 0-7 |
| `PAPER <n>` | Background colour, 0-7 |
| `BORDER <n>` | Screen border colour, 0-7 |
| `FLASH <n>` | Flashing text, `0`/`1` |
| `BRIGHT <n>` | Bright variant of the current colours, `0`/`1` |
| `INVERSE <n>` | Swap ink/paper for the next `PRINT`(s), `0`/`1` — doesn't change the underlying `INK`/`PAPER` values |
| `OVER <n>` | `0` draws normally; `1` XOR-plots subsequent text and graphics, allowing the same glyph or shape to erase itself when drawn twice at one position |

**`PRINT` takes exactly one expression** — there is currently no
`;`/`,` multi-item list the way classic BASIC's `PRINT A; B; C` works.
To show several things on one line, concatenate a string expression
yourself instead:

```
PRINT "X=" + STR$(x) + " Y=" + STR$(y)
```

Or, to put separate values at specific screen positions, use `AT` before
each one, as separate colon-chained statements:

```
AT 0,0 : PRINT "X=" + STR$(x) : AT 0,10 : PRINT "Y=" + STR$(y)
```

Colours: 0=black, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=magenta, 4=green, 5=cyan, 6=yellow,
7=white.

## 9. Graphics

Screen is 256×191 pixels; the `AT`/`TAB` text grid above is a separate,
coarser 32×24 character view of the same physical screen.

| Statement/function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PLOT x,y` | Set one pixel. `x` is 0-255, `y` is 0-191 (out-of-range `y` clamps to the last valid row) |
| `LINE x0,y0 TO x1,y1` | Draw a straight line between two **absolute** points (not classic BASIC's relative-from-last-`PLOT` `DRAW`) |
| `BLOCK x0,y0 TO x1,y1` | Fill a solid rectangle — corners can be given in either order |
| `CIRCLE x,y,r` | Draw a circle outline centred at `x,y` with radius `r`; a circle that would extend past the edge is simply clipped there |
| `FILL x,y` | Flood-fill the connected region starting at that pixel |
| `POINT(x,y)` | Function — `1` if that pixel is currently set, `0` if not |
| `ATTR(row,col)` | Function — normal-screen attribute byte at character row 0-23, column 0-31; returns `0` outside that grid |
| `CPLOT cx,cy` | Coarse 2×2-per-cell block-graphics plot; `cx` is 0-63, `cy` is 0-47 |
| `MODE n` | `0` = Normal, `1` = High Resolution Graphics (same 256×191 bitmap, finer per-scanline colour). Anything else raises `INVALID MODE` |
| `ULAPLUS n` | Enable (`1`) or disable (`0`) the ULAplus extended palette. Other values raise `INVALID ARGUMENT` |
| `PALETTE index,value` | Program ULAplus register `index` (0-63) with an 8-bit `GGGRRRBB` colour value (0-255). Out-of-range arguments raise `INVALID ARGUMENT` |

`PLOT`/`LINE`/`BLOCK`/`CIRCLE`/`CPLOT` all colour using the *current*
`INK`/`PAPER`/`FLASH`/`INVERSE` state, same as `PRINT` — and, unlike
`PRINT`, they genuinely respect `OVER`: with `OVER 0` (the default) a
pixel is set outright; with `OVER 1` it's **XOR-toggled** instead
(plotting the same point twice with `OVER 1` clears it again) — useful
for drawing something temporarily without needing to remember and redraw
whatever was underneath it.

### ULAplus palettes

ULAplus provides 64 programmable colours. Select a palette register with an
index from 0 through 63, then give it an 8-bit colour value in `GGGRRRBB`
format:

- bits 7-5: green, 0-7;
- bits 4-2: red, 0-7;
- bits 1-0: blue, 0-3.

For example, this programs the first eight registers and enables ULAplus:

```basic
PALETTE 0,0
PALETTE 1,3
PALETTE 2,28
PALETTE 3,31
PALETTE 4,224
PALETTE 5,227
PALETTE 6,252
PALETTE 7,255
ULAPLUS 1
```

`PALETTE` stores register values whether ULAplus is currently enabled or not,
so a program can prepare its colours first and then issue `ULAPLUS 1`. Issuing
`ULAPLUS 0` returns to the normal palette without erasing the programmed
values; a later `ULAPLUS 1` reuses them.

ULAplus is deliberately program-scoped. Every route back to the editor—normal
completion, `END`, `STOP`, a runtime error, or `BREAK`—automatically disables
ULAplus so the editor is always readable in the normal display mode. The
programmed palette values remain available to the next `ULAPLUS 1` during that
session.

ULAplus works with the normal screen and with `MODE 1`; it is independent of
the removed 64-column mode and its former TS2068 palette selector. Emulator
support varies: ZEsarUX can enable ULAplus for the TS2068, while an unpatched
upstream Fuse may not expose it for this machine.

## 10. Sprites

A fixed-slot sprite system — 8 slots (0-7), each up to 4×4 character
cells (32×32 pixels).

| Statement/function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SPRITE GRAB slot,row,col,w,h` | Capture whatever's currently on screen at that cell rectangle into `slot`'s own image buffer. Doesn't draw anything yet — can be re-`GRAB`bed any time, shown or not |
| `SPRITE SHOW slot,row,col` | Draw a previously-`GRAB`bed sprite at a screen position, saving what was there first so it can be restored later. Refuses with `SPRITE ALREADY SHOWN` if that slot is already shown — `HIDE` it first |
| `SPRITE HIDE slot` | Restore the background a `SHOW`/`MOVE` saved, and stop drawing that sprite. Refuses with `SPRITE NOT SHOWN` if it isn't currently shown |
| `SPRITE MOVE slot,row,col` | Reposition an already-shown sprite in one step: restores the old background, then shows it at the new position — same net effect as `HIDE` then `SHOW`, just one statement. Also refuses with `SPRITE NOT SHOWN` if it isn't shown yet |
| `HIT(slot1,slot2)` | Function — `1` if both slots are currently shown *and* their rectangles overlap, `0` otherwise (including if either slot number is invalid or not shown — a collision check deliberately never errors, since a game loop calls it every frame) |

`row`/`col` are the same 0-23/0-31 character-cell coordinates `AT` uses;
`w`/`h` are 1-4 (cells, not pixels). An invalid slot number, or a
`GRAB`/`SHOW` rectangle that doesn't fit the screen, raises `BAD SPRITE
SLOT`, `SPRITE TOO LARGE`, or `SPRITE OUT OF RANGE` as appropriate;
using a slot that was never `GRAB`bed raises `SPRITE NOT DEFINED`.

## 11. Sound

| Statement | Effect |
|---|---|
| `BEEP duration,pitch` | A square-wave tone through the speaker. **Not** the real Sinclair `BEEP`'s musical-note/seconds grammar — both arguments here are raw integers: `duration` is a count of full waveform cycles, `pitch` is the busy-wait length per half-cycle (bigger = slower toggling = lower pitch) |
| `SOUND register,data` | Writes directly to the AY-3-8912 sound chip's registers — `register` is 1-16 (anything else raises `INVALID SOUND REGISTER`), `data` is the byte written to it. This one *is* the real Sinclair `SOUND` command's actual register-level behaviour |

The real `SOUND` command accepts a semicolon-chained list of register
pairs on one line; that grammar isn't recognized here — chain multiple
writes with `:` instead: `SOUND 8,15 : SOUND 0,200`.

## 12. Input

| Statement/function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `INPUT <var>` | Reads a numeric scalar or string scalar. `INPUT N` accepts digits and an optional `-`; `INPUT N$` accepts up to 31 printable characters. ENTER commits the value. Unrecognized keys (including DELETE) are ignored |
| `INKEY$()` | Function — the currently-pressed key as a one-character string, or `""` if nothing is pressed. Doesn't wait — call it every loop iteration to poll: `IF INKEY$() = "Q" THEN END` |
| `STICK(device)` | Function — reads a joystick through the AY-3-8912's I/O port. `device` is `1` or `2`; anything else raises `INVALID ARGUMENT`. Device 1 returns a 4-bit direction value; device 2 (a real hardware asymmetry, not a design choice here) only returns a single bit |

`INPUT` reads either a numeric or string scalar. A prompt-string form
(`INPUT "Name: "; A$`) is not yet implemented; print the prompt first.

## 13. Memory and machine code

| Statement/function | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PEEK(addr)` | Function — reads one byte, 0-255 |
| `POKE addr,value` | Writes the low byte of `value` to `addr` |
| `USR(addr)` | Function — jumps to machine code at `addr`; that routine must end with its own `RET`, leaving its result in `HL` |
| `FREE()` | Function — bytes still free in the program area |

These are the classic BASIC raw-memory escape hatch — a program can
touch any address it computes, exactly as on any other 8-bit BASIC's
`PEEK`/`POKE`/`USR`.

## 14. Immediate commands

Typed alone on a line and committed (ENTER), these execute right away
instead of being stored as a program statement — the only statements
that behave this way:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUN` | Runs the whole stored program from the start, after a whole-program error check (see [The editor](#2-the-editor)) |
| `NEW` | Clears the current program *and* every variable, back to the same fresh state as cold boot |
| `LIST` | Jumps the editor view to the top of the program |
| `EDIT <label>` | Rebuilds the label table (so this works even before the program has ever been `RUN`) and jumps straight to that label's line |
| `DELETE <start>,<end>` | Removes a 1-based inclusive range of lines — see [The editor](#2-the-editor) |
| `SAVE "name"` / `LOAD "name"` / `LOAD ""` | Tape transfer — see [Loading and saving with Fuse](#3-loading-and-saving-with-fuse) |
| `HELP` / `HELP <topic>` | Full-screen topic list or a specific topic — see [The editor](#2-the-editor) |

## 15. Function reference

### Math

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `ABS(x)` | Absolute value |
| `SGN(x)` | -1, 0, or 1 |
| `SQR(x)` | Square root — prints with real fractional digits (e.g. `1.4142`) when `PRINT SQR(x)` is the *entire* printed expression; falls back to a truncated integer when composed into a larger expression (`SQR(x)+1`) |
| `SIN(x)` | Sine of `x` **degrees** (not radians — see below) — same fractional-display behaviour as `SQR` when printed alone |
| `PI()` | 3.1415... — called with empty parens, like `FREE()` |
| `RAD(x)` | Degrees to radians (`x * pi / 180`) |
| `DEG(x)` | Radians to degrees (`x * 180 / pi`) |
| `MOD(x,y)` | Remainder, taking the dividend's sign (`-17 MOD 5` = `-2`) |
| `DIV(x,y)` | Integer division, truncating toward zero (`-17 DIV 5` = `-3`) |
| `INT(x)` | No-op — every number here is already an integer |
| `RND(x)` | Pseudo-random value in `[0, x-1]` for positive `x`; `0` for `x<=0` |

`SIN` takes **degrees**, not radians — a deliberate choice, since with
no float literals in this language an integer number of radians would
almost never land near a recognizable angle.

`COS`/`TAN`/`EXP`/`LN`/`LOG10` are not implemented.

**`RANDOMISE <n>`** (a statement, not a function) reseeds `RND`:
`RANDOMISE 0` reseeds from real hardware entropy (same as never having
seeded at all, or a cold boot); `RANDOMISE n` for a nonzero `n` sets
that as the new deterministic seed — useful when you want the same
"random" sequence to repeat (e.g. for testing).

### String

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `CHR$(n)` | The one-character string with ASCII code `n` (0-255) |
| `STR$(n)` | `n` formatted as a decimal string |
| `UPPER$(s$)` | `s$` with `a`-`z` converted to `A`-`Z` |
| `LOWER$(s$)` | The reverse of `UPPER$` |
| `LEFT$(s$,n)` | The first `n` characters (clamps at either end rather than erroring) |
| `RIGHT$(s$,n)` | The last `n` characters (same clamping) |
| `LEN(s$)` | Length, 0-31 |
| `CODE(s$)` | ASCII code of the first character, `0` for an empty string |
| `VAL(s$)` | Parses a decimal integer from the start of `s$` (tolerates a leading `-`, stops at the first non-digit); `0` if nothing parseable |

`INSTR` and `FILL$` are not implemented.

### Other

| Function | Returns |
|---|---|
| `FREE()` | Bytes free in the program area |
| `DIMN(name)` | An array's declared size |
| `PEEK(addr)` | One byte at `addr` |
| `USR(addr)` | Runs machine code at `addr`, `HL` result |
| `POINT(x,y)` | `1`/`0` — is that pixel set |
| `ATTR(row,col)` | Attribute byte at a normal-screen character cell, or `0` out of range |
| `INKEY$()` | Currently-pressed key, or `""` |
| `STICK(device)` | Joystick reading |
| `HIT(slot1,slot2)` | `1`/`0` — do two shown sprites overlap |

running to the end of the line — `REM this is ignored`, or trailing:
`x = 1 : REM note`. A `:` inside `REM`'s own text is just more comment
text, not a new statement.

## 18. Keyboard reference

### Cursor and editing

| Combo | Action |
|---|---|
| CAPS SHIFT + 5 | Left |
| CAPS SHIFT + 6 | Down |
| CAPS SHIFT + 7 | Up |

Fuse maps your PC's real arrow keys and Backspace directly to the
corresponding combos above.

### Block-graphics characters

The TS2068 number keys carry block-graphics legends. 2068 Leap can render
the corresponding 16 two-by-two mosaic characters, but its current keyboard
decoder does **not** yet enter them directly from those key combinations.
In BASIC, print them with `CHR$(128+n)`, where `n` is the quadrant mask:

- bit 0 = top right
- bit 1 = top left
- bit 2 = bottom right
- bit 3 = bottom left

| Code | Filled quadrants | Code | Filled quadrants |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 128 | none (blank) | 136 | bottom left |
| 129 | top right | 137 | top right, bottom left |
| 130 | top left | 138 | left half |
| 131 | top half | 139 | top half, bottom left |
| 132 | bottom right | 140 | bottom half |
| 133 | right half | 141 | top right, bottom half |
| 134 | top left, bottom right | 142 | top left, bottom half |
| 135 | top half, bottom right | 143 | all (solid) |

For example, `PRINT CHR$(133)` prints a solid right-half block. `CPLOT`
uses the same quadrant idea with coarse coordinates, without requiring
character codes.

A handful of SYMBOL SHIFT letter combos (`X`, `I`, `U`, `Y`, `H`) have no
mapping in this ROM yet. `Q`/`W`/`E` (which give the two-character
tokens `<=`/`<>`/`>=` on real hardware) are deliberately not mapped
either — just type the two characters in sequence instead (`<` then
`=`), which this BASIC's own parser already reads the same way.

## 19. Known limitations

Worth knowing before you go looking for something that isn't there:

- **No line-numbered `GOTO`, no `RENUMBER`** — this dialect never had
  line numbers to begin with; see [Program structure](#4-program-structure--labels-instead-of-line-numbers).
- **`PRINT` takes one expression, not a `;`/`,` list** — concatenate a
  string yourself instead (see [Screen output](#8-screen-output)).
- **No `REPeat`/`SELect ON`/`DEFine PROCedure`/`DEFine FuNction`/`WHEN
  ERRor`** — designed in `docs/basic_language_reference.md` but not
  built. Use `GOTO`/`GOSUB`/`IF`/`FOR` for everything today.
- **No `DATA`/`RESTORE`/`READ`** — use a `DIM`'d array instead.
- **No multi-dimensional arrays.** Numeric and string arrays are one-dimensional.
- **No prompt-string form for `INPUT`.** Print a prompt immediately before
  `INPUT` instead.
- **`OVER 1` XOR-plots both text and graphics.** Printing or plotting the
  same shape twice at the same position restores the original bitmap.
- **`COS`/`TAN`/`EXP`/`LN`/`LOG10`/`INSTR`/`FILL$` are not implemented.**
- **`SAVE`/`LOAD` uses TS2068 tape framing but this ROM's native program
  payload.** A stock ROM cannot execute that non-Sinclair BASIC payload.
- **No `MERGE`** — `LOAD` always replaces the current program outright.
